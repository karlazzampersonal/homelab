I bought a domain name from porkbun (domain name registrar). The eventual goal is to have some public facing services inside our kubernetes cluster.
To do that, we first need to configure DNS records for our domain name.

This must be done for multiple reasons:

<Steps>
    1. **Domain Resolution**:  DNS records enable domain name resolution, translating human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to communicate over the internet.
    2. **Service Accessibility**: By setting up DNS records correctly, you ensure that public facing services hosted in the homelab can be accessed using the domain name instead of the public IP address.
</Steps>

### DNS records we are adding

- **A Record**: Maps your domain name to an IPv4 address.
- **CNAME Record**: Creates an alias for your domain. Using this for subdomains.

## Add DNS records

<Steps>
1. Find your ip address, you can get it by going to `google.com` and typing "What is my IP"
2. Go to [porkbun domain management page](https://porkbun.com/account/domainsSpeedy) and click the edit icon next to `DNS Records`
3. Add an A record with TTL of 600, set host text box to `www` and set answer text box to your ip address.
4. Add an A record with TTL of 600,  host text box should be empty and set answer text box to your ip address.
</Steps>
