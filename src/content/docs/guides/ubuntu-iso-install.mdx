I am not running a hypervisor such as Proxmox since I want to run kubernetes bare-metal in Ubuntu. So I'll need
to put the Ubuntu ISO on a USB stick so that I can install it each Mini PC. I went with Ubuntu as my Linux OS since it has excellent
documentation and is relatively stable. I went with 24.04 as it's the latest LTS version.

## Setup Instructions on a Mac

<Aside type="danger">These instructions are for installing on a Mac only, and make sure you have a USB stick with at least 8 GB of free memory.</Aside>

<Steps>
1. Plug the USB stick in.
2. Go to [Ubuntu 24.04 page](https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04) and click on `Server Install Image` since we're using these as servers.
3. Cd into the downloads folder where the ISO file is.
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```
4. List all of the disks on the mac. You should see one listed for `(external, physical)`. That's the USB stick, make note of the disk name. For me it is `/dev/disk4`.
    ```bash
    sudo diskutil list
    ```
5. Now we are going to erase the contents of the disk completely. Replace `/dev/disk4` with your disk name for this command and all following commands.
    ```bash
    sudo diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 USB /dev/disk4
    ```
6. Since erasing the content mounts the usb disk, we need to unmount it before adding our ISO file.
    ```bash
    sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4
    ```
7. Finally, let's add the ISO file to the disk. Change the file name to be the name of your iso file along with the disk name.
    ```bash
    sudo dd if=./ubuntu-24.04-beta-live-server-amd64.iso of=/dev/disk4 bs=1m
    ```
    <Aside>You will notice an error after this step saying the disk is not readable, click eject anyways, this error is expected since Macs can't read the new filesystem on the USB stick.</Aside>
