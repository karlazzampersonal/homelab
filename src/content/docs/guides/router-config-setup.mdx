I have a Netgear Nighthawk router. I want to configure two things:


<Steps>
    1. **Static IPs for all Minipcs**: This is very important so that my minipcs (which have private ips) never change their ip address. So when I run an ansible playbook, I never have to worry about the ip addresses changing.
    2. **Expose external traffic**: By setting up port forwarding rules on the route for ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), I can host things publicly to the outside world.
</Steps>

### Making the ips static

<Steps>
1. Go to [router login page](http://www.routerlogin.net/start.htm)
2. Click the `ADVANCED` tab. Under `Setup`, click on `LAN Setup`
    <Image src={lan_setup_menu} alt="lan setup menu"/>
3. Click `Add` under `Address Reservation`. This is where you can map your minipc's mac address to a static ip address.
    <Image src={address_reservation} alt="address reservation"/>
4. After adding all the addresses, it looks something like this:
    <Image src={address_reservation_filled_out} alt="address reservation filled out"/>
</Steps>

## Port forwarding http and https

Your service load balancer (i.e. ServiceLB, MetalLB) will give your external load balancer (i.e. ingress-nginx, traefik) an IP, that is what you would port forward. Once that is done, you control it with Ingress objects

<Steps>
1. Go to [router login page](http://www.routerlogin.net/)
2. Click the `ADVANCED` tab. Under `Advanced Setup`, click on `Port forwarding/Port Triggering`
    <Image src={port_forwarding_menu} alt="Port forwarding advanced setup menu"/>
3. Make sure the radio button for `Port Forwarding` is selected. For HTTP, on the drop down for service name select `HTTP`. Change the address ip address to the external load balancer ip. Then click `Add`.

4. For HTTPS, click `Add custom service`. Then the config should look like below. (Other than the ip address should be same as the one for HTTP above)
    <Image src={port_forwarding_https} alt="Port forwarding https"/>
</Steps>
