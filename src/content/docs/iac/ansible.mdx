## Installing ansible
Let's start by installing ansible on the Mac, along with some linting tools

```shell
pip3 install ansible yamllint ansible-lint
```

## Run security playbook
Let's run our first playbook that will harden our SSH config, install fail2ban, and configure auto-updates

<Steps>
1. First [clone the repo](https://github.com/karlazzampersonal/ansible-security) containing the security playbook.

2. If you don't have an `inventory/hosts.ini` file setup, you can replace the contents of the encrypted one, file template should look like this:
    ```yml

    [servers]
    xxx.yyy.z.aa
    xxx.yyy.z.bb
    xxx.yyy.z.cc

    # variables for all the servers
    [servers:vars]
    ansible_ssh_user=myusername
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ansible_port=22
    ```
    
    Then you can encrypt the file:
    ```sh
    ansible-vault encrypt inventory/hosts.ini
    ```

    3. Run the playbook.
    ```shell
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -b -K --ask-vault-pass
    ```
</Steps>
