} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Installing ansible
Let's start by installing ansible on the Mac, along with some linting tools

```shell
pip3 install ansible yamllint ansible-lint
```

## Run security playbook
Let's run our first playbook that will harden our SSH config, install fail2ban, and configure auto-updates

<Steps>
1. First [clone the repo](https://github.com/karlazzampersonal/ansible-security) containing the security playbook.

2. If you don't have an `inventory/hosts.ini` file setup, you can replace the contents of the encrypted one, file template should look like this:
    ```yml

    [servers]
    192.168.1.1
    192.168.1.2
    192.168.1.3

    # variables for all the servers
    [servers:vars]
    ansible_ssh_user=myusername
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ansible_port=34168
    ```
    
    Then you can encrypt the file:
    ```sh
    ansible-vault encrypt inventory/hosts.ini
    ```
3. Run the playbook.
    ```shell
    ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -b -K --ask-vault-pass
    ```
</Steps>

## Run k3s playbook

### Deploy k3s cluster
Next, let's run our main playbook that will deploy our k3s cluster.

<Steps>
1. First [clone the repo](https://github.com/karlazzampersonal/ansible-k3s) containing the k3s playbook.
2. If you don't have an `inventory/hosts.ini` file setup, you can replace the contents of the encrypted one, make sure you pass in the token. File template should look like this:
    ```yml
    [servers]
    192.168.1.1
    192.168.1.2
    192.168.1.3

    # variables for all the servers
    [servers:vars]
    ansible_ssh_user=myusername
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ansible_port=34168

    # secret, make sure this file is in ansible vault to encrypt it
    token=mytoken
    ```

    Then you can encrypt the file:
    ```sh
    ansible-vault encrypt inventory/hosts.ini
    ```
2. Run the playbook:
    ```sh
    ansible-playbook playbook/provision.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -K --ask-vault-pass
    ```
3. To verify the k3s cluster is running via kubectl, ssh into the main controller node and run get pods
    ```sh
    ssh username@xxx.yyy.z.a
    kubectl config use-context default
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
</Steps>

### Tear down k3s cluster
<Steps>
1. First [clone the repo](https://github.com/karlazzampersonal/ansible-k3s) containing the k3s playbook.
2. Run the playbook:
    ```sh
    ansible-playbook playbook/destroy.yml -i inventory/hosts.ini -K --ask-vault-pass
    ```
</Steps>
